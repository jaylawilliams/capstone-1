    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        With my background in operations management, I am now pursuing a transition into web development. My experience working on various websites via content management system (CMS) software has allowed me to develop a solid foundation in managing publishing workflows, search engine optimization, and troubleshooting. I'm currently developing my coding and web development skills through independent study and work on various projects. In doing so, my ultimate goal is to create and manage user-friendly, responsive web interfaces.
